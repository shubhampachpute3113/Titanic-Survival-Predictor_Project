Project Name :  Titanic Survival Predictor 

Technology :  Supervised Machine Learning with Logistic Regression using Python

Description :  
• This application is based on supervised machine learning technique.   

• There is one data set which contains information about all passengers from titanic such as its name, age, seat number , ticket price, height, floor etc. 

• We first clean the data set by removing unnecessary entries and columns. 

• We apply Logistic regression technique to train our dataset and predict whether the passenger can survive or not depends on its data entries.
